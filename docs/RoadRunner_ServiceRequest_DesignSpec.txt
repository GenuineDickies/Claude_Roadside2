Form Purpose & Context1.1 Primary Use CaseThe Service Request Intake Form is the primary data entry interface for dispatchers processing incoming roadside assistance and mobile mechanic calls. It serves as the single point of entry for all service tickets within the RoadRunner Admin platform, transforming phone-based emergency requests into structured, actionable service orders.Every service engagement—from a simple jumpstart to a complex mobile repair—begins with this form. It must balance the urgency of emergency situations with the need to capture comprehensive data for routing, billing, and operational tracking.1.2 Target UsersPrimary users are dispatch operators who handle incoming calls during business hours and after-hours emergency shifts. These users have the following characteristics:High call volume requiring rapid form completion (target: under 90 seconds for standard requests)Working in a low-light dispatch environment optimized for screen visibilitySimultaneously managing multiple active service ticketsVarying technical expertise—form must be intuitive without deep automotive knowledgeUsing both desktop workstations and tablets during mobile dispatch scenarios1.3 Workflow PositionThe intake form sits at the beginning of the service lifecycle within the RoadRunner Admin Operations module:Incoming Call → Dispatcher answers and opens new Service Request formData Capture → Dispatcher populates fields while on the call with the customerTicket Creation → Form submission generates a Service Ticket with unique IDTechnician Assignment → Ticket enters the dispatch queue for routingSMS Notification → Customer receives automated confirmation (10DLC compliant)Service Execution → Technician receives job details on mobile deviceCompletion & Billing → Service record closes and triggers invoicing1.4 Integration ContextThe form interfaces with several existing and planned RoadRunner Admin modules:Operations ModuleService ticket queue, active dispatch board, technician GPS trackingFleet ManagementVehicle/equipment availability, technician assignment poolService CatalogPredefined service types, labor rates, and parts lookup from the 21-table database schemaCustomer DatabaseCustomer lookup, history retrieval, and auto-population of returning customer dataFinancial TrackingPayment processing triggers, invoice generation, and revenue recordingSMS/Notifications10DLC compliant transactional messages via Telnyx for confirmations and ETAs2. Required Data FieldsFields are organized into logical sections that mirror the natural flow of a dispatch call. Each section can be collapsed/expanded to reduce visual clutter. Required fields are marked with asterisks in the UI and enforced at submission.2.1 Customer Identification & ContactThis section captures who is requesting service. For returning customers, the system auto-populates from the customer database after phone number or name match.Field NameData TypeRequiredValidationNotes / OptionsCustomer Phone*PhoneYesUS format, 10 digitsPrimary lookup key; triggers auto-fill for returning customersCustomer Name*TextYesMin 2 charsFirst and Last name fields; auto-populated for returning customersAlt Contact PhonePhoneNoUS formatSecondary contact if customer becomes unreachableEmail AddressEmailNoValid email formatFor invoice delivery and follow-up; optional during emergency callsCustomer TypeSelectYesMust select oneOptions: Individual, Fleet Account, Insurance Referral, Motor Club, CommercialAccount/Policy #TextConditionalFormat varies by typeRequired when Customer Type is Insurance Referral, Motor Club, or Fleet AccountCaller RelationSelectNoNoneOptions: Vehicle Owner, Driver, Passenger, Third Party; defaults to Vehicle Owner2.2 Vehicle InformationVehicle data is critical for technician preparation and parts lookup.

UI/UX Design Requirements3.1 Visual Design SystemThe form must adhere to the RoadRunner Admin dark command center aesthetic. This is not merely a dark theme—it is designed for extended use in low-light dispatch environments where eye strain reduction and information density are paramount.3.1.1 Color PaletteTokenHex ValueUsageCSS VariableBackground#0D1117Page/app background--rr-bg-primarySurface#161B22Cards, panels, form sections--rr-bg-surfaceSurface Elevated#1A2332Focused/active panels, modals--rr-bg-elevatedBorder#30363DDividers, field borders--rr-borderText Primary#C9D1D9Body text, field values--rr-text-primaryText Muted#8B949ELabels, placeholders, hints--rr-text-mutedAccent Blue#58A6FFLinks, focus rings, active tabs--rr-accentSuccess Green#3FB950Confirmations, available status--rr-successWarning Amber#D29922Urgency indicators, validation--rr-warningDanger Red#F85149Errors, emergency priority, required--rr-danger3.1.2 TypographyFont stack: Inter (primary), system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif. Inter provides excellent readability at small sizes in dark environments.Section headers: 18px / semibold / text-primaryField labels: 13px / medium / text-muted (uppercase tracking: 0.05em)Field values: 15px / regular / text-primaryPlaceholder text: 15px / regular / text-muted (50% opacity)Help text: 12px / regular / text-mutedError messages: 12px / medium / danger-red3.1.3 Component StylingInput fields: Background #0D1117 (matching page bg for inset effect), 1px border #30363D, border-radius 6px, padding 10px 12px. Focus state: border transitions to #58A6FF with 0 0 0 3px rgba(88,166,255,0.3) box-shadow.Buttons: Primary actions use filled #58A6FF background with #FFFFFF text. Secondary actions use ghost style with #30363D border. Danger actions use #F85149 background. All buttons: border-radius 6px, padding 10px 20px, font-weight 600.Toggles: Custom switch component using accent-blue for active state, #30363D for inactive track, with smooth 200ms transition.3.2 Layout StructureThe form uses a multi-panel layout optimized for dispatch efficiency:3.2.1 Desktop Layout (1200px+)Three-column layout: Left panel (320px fixed) for customer lookup and quick actions. Center panel (fluid, min 600px) for the main form content. Right panel (280px collapsible) for the live map preview and ticket summary.The center form panel organizes fields into collapsible accordion sections matching the data field groups in Section 2. Each section shows a completion indicator (checkmark when all required fields populated) and can be navigated via a sticky section nav bar at the top of the form area.3.2.2 Tablet Layout (768px–1199px)Two-column layout: Left panel collapses to an icon rail with flyout. Center panel expands to fill available space. Right panel becomes a toggleable overlay accessed via a floating map button. Form sections stack vertically with the same accordion behavior.3.2.3 Mobile Layout (<768px)Single-column stacked layout with bottom navigation tabs: Form, Map, Summary. Form sections become swipeable cards. A persistent bottom bar shows ticket status, estimated cost, and the primary action button (Create Ticket / Dispatch).3.3 Form Validation & Error HandlingValidation follows a progressive strategy to avoid interrupting the dispatcher during active calls:3.3.1 Validation TiersTier 1 – Inline (real-time): Format validation on blur for phone numbers, emails, VIN check digits. Visual indicator only (red border + icon), no modal interruption. Auto-formatting applied (phone number masking, VIN uppercasing).Tier 2 – Section (on collapse): When a dispatcher collapses/navigates away from a section, validate required fields within that section. Incomplete required fields highlighted with amber border and section header shows warning badge.Tier 3 – Submission (on Create Ticket): Full validation pass on form submit. Missing required fields scrolls to first error with red highlight. Error summary panel appears at top of form listing all issues with jump-to-field links. Submission blocked until all Tier 3 validations pass.3.3.2 Validation BypassFor true emergency situations, the form supports a Rapid Dispatch mode that requires only: Customer Phone, Service Location, Service Category, and Priority Level. All other fields can be populated post-dispatch. Activating Rapid Dispatch requires a visible toggle in the form header and generates a warning-state ticket that enters a follow-up queue.3.4 Progressive DisclosureThe form adapts its visible complexity based on the service type selected:Towing services: Reveals Tow Destination, Tow Distance, Drive Type, and Special Equipment sectionsLockout services: Reveals Keys Available toggle, lock type questions, and spare key inquiryMobile Repair services: Reveals diagnostic symptom checklist, parts lookup integration, and labor estimate calculatorFuel Delivery: Reveals fuel type selector (Regular, Premium, Diesel) and quantity fieldJump Start: Minimal additional fields—streamlined for fastest possible dispatchConditional fields animate in with a 200ms slide-down transition to avoid jarring layout shifts. Hidden conditional fields are excluded from validation until visible.4. Technical Specifications4.1 Database Schema IntegrationThe intake form maps to the existing RoadRunner 21-table database schema. The primary table for service requests is service_tickets, with foreign key relationships to customers, vehicles, service_types, and technicians.4.1.1 Core Table MappingsForm SectionPrimary TableKey ColumnsRelationshipsCustomer Infocustomersid, phone, name, email, type1:M → service_ticketsVehicle Infocustomer_vehiclesid, year, make, model, vin, plateM:1 → customersService Detailsservice_ticketsid, category, status, priority, notesM:1 → customers, vehiclesService Line Itemsticket_servicesid, ticket_id, service_type_id, qtyM:1 → service_tickets, service_typesLocationticket_locationsid, ticket_id, lat, lng, address, typeM:1 → service_ticketsPaymentticket_billingid, ticket_id, method, quoted, auth_code1:1 → service_ticketsAttachmentsticket_attachmentsid, ticket_id, file_path, typeM:1 → service_ticketsAudit Trailticket_historyid, ticket_id, action, user_id, timestampM:1 → service_tickets4.1.2 Ticket ID GenerationService tickets use a human-readable ID format: RR-YYYYMMDD-XXXX where RR is the company prefix, YYYYMMDD is the creation date, and XXXX is a daily sequential counter (zero-padded). Example: RR-20260207-0042. This format is sortable, date-identifiable, and easy to communicate over the phone.4.2 Real-Time Features4.2.1 GPS & Mapping IntegrationThe form embeds a live map component (Google Maps or Mapbox) in the right panel that serves multiple purposes:Customer location pin: Updates in real-time as the address field is populated; supports drag-to-adjust for fine-tuningTechnician positions: Shows all active technicians as color-coded markers (green = available, yellow = en route, red = on job)Tow route preview: When tow destination is entered, displays the route with distance and estimated drive timeService area boundary: Subtle overlay showing the business service area; warns if customer location is outsideMap data refreshes on a 15-second polling interval for technician positions, with WebSocket fallback for browsers that support it.4.2.2 Dispatcher NotificationsThe form participates in the RoadRunner notification system:Priority alerts: P1 tickets trigger an audible alert and visual banner across all dispatcher workstationsAssignment confirmations: When a technician acknowledges a dispatched ticket, the originating form/ticket updates in real-timeETA updates: Technician GPS-based ETA recalculations push to the ticket and trigger customer SMS if the change exceeds 10 minutesCollision detection: If two dispatchers begin creating tickets for the same customer phone number simultaneously, both receive a warning4.3 Service Catalog IntegrationThe service type selection fields pull directly from the service catalog database:Service categories and types populate from the service_types and service_categories tablesLabor rate estimates auto-calculate based on the labor_rates table for the selected service type and time of day (standard vs. after-hours)Parts lookup is available as an inline search within the form, querying the parts_inventory table for availability and pricingPrice estimation combines service base rate + parts cost + tow mileage rate (from rate_schedules table) to generate the Estimated Cost field automaticallyAll catalog data is cached client-side with a 5-minute TTL to ensure form responsiveness even during high-traffic periods.4.4 SMS Notification Triggers (10DLC Compliance)The form triggers automated SMS messages via the Telnyx API at specific workflow points. All messages comply with 10DLC registration requirements for transactional messaging.Trigger EventTimingMessage ContentCompliance NotesTicket CreatedImmediateConfirmation with ticket ID, service type, and estimated arrivalRequires prior opt-in; includes STOP instructionsTechnician DispatchedOn assignmentTechnician name, vehicle description, and updated ETATransactional; no marketing contentETA UpdateOn 10+ min changeUpdated arrival time with brief explanationOnly sent if ETA changes significantlyTechnician ArrivedOn arrivalNotification that technician is on sceneGPS-triggered automatic sendService CompleteOn closeSummary, final cost, and payment confirmationIncludes link to digital receiptFollow-Up Survey24 hours postBrief satisfaction survey linkSeparate campaign; requires explicit consentSMS opt-in is captured during the intake call. The dispatcher confirms verbal consent with the customer and checks the SMS Consent toggle on the form. The consent timestamp, method (verbal-dispatcher), and customer phone are recorded in the sms_consent table per Telnyx 10DLC requirements.4.5 API ArchitectureThe form communicates with the RoadRunner backend via a RESTful API:POST /api/v1/tickets – Creates a new service ticket from form submission payloadGET /api/v1/customers/lookup?phone={phone} – Customer auto-fill lookup by phone numberGET /api/v1/catalog/services?category={id} – Service type dropdown populationGET /api/v1/catalog/parts/search?q={query} – Inline parts searchPOST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/dispatch – Assigns technician and triggers notification chainGET /api/v1/technicians/available?lat={lat}&lng={lng} – Nearest available technician queryPOST /api/v1/estimates/calculate – Real-time price estimation based on selected services and locationAll API responses follow a consistent envelope: { success: boolean, data: object, errors: array, meta: { timestamp, request_id } }. Authentication uses JWT tokens with role-based access control (dispatcher, admin, technician roles).5. Workflow Considerations5.1 Form Completion Time OptimizationThe target for a standard service request is 90 seconds or less from form open to ticket creation. For emergency (P1) requests using Rapid Dispatch mode, the target is 30 seconds. The following strategies achieve this:5.1.1 Keyboard-First DesignTab order follows natural call flow: phone number → customer name → vehicle → location → service → priority → payment → submitAll dropdowns support type-ahead search (e.g., typing “Toy” in Make field immediately filters to Toyota)Global keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Enter to submit, Ctrl+Shift+R for Rapid Dispatch, Ctrl+M to toggle map panelEscape key closes any open dropdown or modal without losing entered data5.1.2 Smart DefaultsPriority auto-sets to P2-Urgent for new tickets (most common scenario)Payment Method defaults to Credit/Debit Card (most common for individual customers)Vehicle Condition defaults to “No Start” for the most frequent service categoriesLocation Type defaults based on time of day: “Residence” during 6am–10am, “Roadside” otherwiseCurrent date/time auto-populates all timestamp fields5.2 Conditional Field LogicThe form dynamically adjusts based on prior field selections to reduce cognitive load:Trigger ConditionFields Shown/HiddenAdditional BehaviorCategory = TowingShow: Tow Destination, Drive Type, Special EquipmentAuto-calculate tow distance; pre-check flatbed if AWD/4WDCategory = LockoutShow: Key status, Lock typeHide vehicle condition; focus on access methodCategory = Fuel DeliveryShow: Fuel type, QuantityHide most vehicle diagnostics; simplified formCategory = Mobile RepairShow: Symptom checklist, Parts lookupExpand issue description; suggest common diagnosticsCustomer Type = FleetShow: Fleet Account #, PO fieldAuto-load fleet rate schedule; apply negotiated pricingCustomer Type = InsuranceShow: Policy #, Claim #, Adjuster contactLoad insurance-specific pricing; add authorization workflowLocation Type = HighwayShow: Highway name, Direction, Mile markerAuto-escalate to P2 minimum prioritySafe Location = NoShow: Safety detail text fieldAuto-escalate to P1; alert on-duty supervisorPriority = P4 ScheduledShow: Date/time pickerHide ETA fields; show calendar availability5.3 Dispatcher Efficiency Features5.3.1 Customer Auto-CompleteWhen the dispatcher enters a phone number, the system searches the customer database in real-time. If a match is found, a preview card appears showing the customer name, vehicle(s) on file, last service date, and account status. Selecting the customer auto-populates: Customer Name, Email, Customer Type, all Vehicle Information fields (with option to select from multiple vehicles), and preferred payment method. For partial matches (first 6+ digits), a dropdown shows up to 5 possible matches.5.3.2 Recent Customers PanelThe left panel displays the 20 most recent customer interactions, searchable and filterable. Each entry shows: customer name, phone, last service type, and date. Clicking any entry opens a new form pre-populated with that customer’s information, streamlining repeat callers.5.3.3 Service TemplatesDispatchers can save frequently used form configurations as templates:Fleet templates: Pre-configured for specific fleet accounts with their vehicles, billing codes, and authorized servicesMotor club templates: Pre-populated with insurance/motor club authorization workflows and coverage-specific service limitsCommon scenario templates: “Jump Start”, “Flat Tire”, “Basic Tow” with typical field values pre-filledTemplates are managed via the Admin settings and are shared across all dispatchers. Individual dispatchers can also create personal quick-access templates.5.3.4 Dispatcher Shorthand ParserThe Issue Description field supports a shorthand syntax for rapid data entry. Examples:"js" auto-tags as Jump Start category"ft lr" parses as Flat Tire, Left Rear"lo keys" parses as Lockout, keys locked inside"tow 15mi" parses as Towing with approximate 15-mile distanceThe parser suggests the interpreted values below the field for dispatcher confirmation, but never auto-changes field values without explicit acceptance.5.4 Technician Assignment & Routing HandoffOnce the ticket is created, the form transitions to the assignment workflow:5.4.1 Assignment OptionsAuto-Assign: System selects the optimal technician based on: proximity to customer (GPS), current workload, skill match for the service type, equipment match (e.g., flatbed for towing), and shift schedule. The algorithm weights proximity at 40%, skill match at 30%, workload at 20%, and shift remaining time at 10%.Manual Assign: Dispatcher selects from a list of available technicians sorted by recommended fit. Each technician card shows: name, current location, distance/ETA to customer, active job count, skills/certifications, and vehicle/equipment type.Queue: Ticket enters the dispatch queue without assignment for supervisor review or when no technicians are available. Queue position is determined by priority level and creation timestamp.5.4.2 Routing & DispatchWhen a technician is assigned (auto or manual):The ticket status changes from Created to DispatchedThe technician receives a push notification on their mobile app with job detailsTurn-by-turn routing is generated from the technician’s current GPS position to the customer locationThe customer SMS confirmation is triggered (if consent was given)The dispatcher’s active board updates to show the assignment with a live ETA trackerIf the technician does not acknowledge within 3 minutes, the ticket auto-escalates to the next available technician or alerts the dispatcher5.4.3 Post-Dispatch Form StateAfter dispatch, the form transitions to a read-only ticket view with a live status timeline. The dispatcher can still add notes, update payment information, and make limited modifications (customer phone correction, additional services requested). Major changes (service location, service type) require ticket recall and re-dispatch with supervisor approval.6. Appendices6.1 Ticket Status LifecycleDraft → Created → Dispatched → Acknowledged → En Route → On Scene → In Progress → Completed → ClosedBranching statuses: Cancelled (from any pre-Completed state), Escalated (from any state), On Hold (from Dispatched or Acknowledged, returns to Dispatched).6.2 Role-Based Field AccessField GroupDispatcherTechnicianAdminCustomer Contact InfoRead/WriteRead OnlyRead/WriteVehicle DetailsRead/WriteRead/WriteRead/WriteLocation DataRead/WriteRead OnlyRead/WriteService Type & DiagnosisRead/WriteRead/WriteRead/WritePriority & SchedulingRead/WriteRead OnlyRead/WritePayment & BillingRead/WriteView Amount OnlyRead/WriteInternal NotesRead/WriteRead OnlyRead/WriteBilling AdjustmentsLimitedNo AccessFull Access6.3 Performance RequirementsForm initial load< 1.5 seconds on broadband, < 3 seconds on 4GCustomer lookup response< 300ms from APIAddress autocomplete< 200ms per keystroke debounced at 150msService catalog load< 500ms (cached); < 1s (cache miss)Ticket submission< 2 seconds including all backend processingMap tile rendering< 1 second for initial render; smooth 60fps pan/zoomSMS delivery< 5 seconds from trigger event to carrier handoffConcurrent dispatchersSupport 10+ simultaneous users without degradation6.4 Accessibility RequirementsThe form must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with particular attention to the dark theme contrast ratios. All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable with visible focus indicators. Screen reader support includes proper ARIA labels on all form fields, live regions for dynamic content updates (ETA changes, validation errors), and meaningful announcements for status transitions. Color is never the sole indicator of state—icons and text labels accompany all color-coded information.6.5 Future Enhancements (Roadmap)Voice-to-form: Speech recognition integration to auto-populate fields during the callAI issue classification: Natural language processing on the issue description to auto-suggest service category and partsPredictive dispatch: ML model trained on historical data to pre-position technicians in high-demand areasCustomer self-service: Web/app form for non-emergency requests that feeds into the same ticket systemPhoto-based diagnosis: Customer uploads vehicle photo; computer vision assists in issue identificationMulti-language support: Dynamic form localization for the dispatcher interface and customer-facing SMS
