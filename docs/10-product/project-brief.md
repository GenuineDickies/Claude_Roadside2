# Project Brief — RoadRunner Admin

## Problem
Independent roadside assistance and mobile mechanic operators need a centralized system to manage service requests, dispatch technicians, track work, and handle invoicing — without expensive SaaS subscriptions.

## Solution
RoadRunner Admin — a self-hosted PHP web application providing:
- Service request intake with customer/vehicle capture
- Technician dispatch and assignment
- Full document chain: Estimate → Work Order → Invoice → Receipt
- Expense tracking and basic financial reporting
- Compliance management for licenses and certifications
- Service catalog for pricing

## Users
- **Admin/Dispatcher:** Manages requests, assigns techs, generates documents
- **Technician:** (Future) Views assigned jobs, updates status in field

## Success Criteria
- Complete service lifecycle management in one tool
- Sub-second page loads
- Works on mobile devices
- Zero external service dependencies (self-hosted)
